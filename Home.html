  <h2>Cyber Security</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>
    The economic and social benefits of digital technology have transformed the world as we know it, but have introduced high risks through its malicious use by both state and non-state actors. These risks affecting economies, societies and livelihoods, and are threatening international peace and security. 
    <br>
  
    Cyber threats are a global risk that governments, the private sector, non-governmental organizations – and the global community as a whole – must deal with. Chatham House focuses on building cyber capacity and expertise among policymakers, investigating key issues through publishing in-depth policy research, conducting cyber simulation exercises, and convening high-level meetings with a wide group of stakeholders.
    A major focus of this work for Chatham House is carried out by the International Security programme with its Cyber Policy Portfolio. Through covering a wide range of cyber areas and pioneering a number of programmes at the global, regional and national levels, the programme's cyber policy work aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the risks, opportunities and potential ways forward associated with the security of the digital technology.
